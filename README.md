# Covid Data Analysis
##SQL
Exploritory data analysis of covid statistics using SQL.
This was my first SQL project, so its got some basic queries that just look at the data and how its structured.
Toward the end aggregate functions, CTE, views, and tables are used.
##Tableu
To visualize the data in the TableuQueries.sql I had to save the output from the four queries to an excel file because thats the only way when you dont have a membership. From there I picked how to visualize the data from all sorts of table and graph options.
